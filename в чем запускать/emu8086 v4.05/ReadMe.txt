    Introduction
    ============
    
    emu8086 is the emulator of 8086 (Intel and AMD compatible) microprocessor 
    and integrated assembler with tutorials for beginners. 
    The emulator runs programs like the real microprocessor in step-by-step mode.
    It shows registers, memory, stack, variables and flags. 
    All memory values can be investigated and edited by a double click.
    The instructions can be executed back and forward.
    
    emu8086 can create a tiny operating system and write its binary code to
    a bootable floppy disk. The software package includes  several external virtual
    devices: robot, stepper motor, led display, and traffic lights intersection. 
    Virtually anyone with any programming experience can design 
    animated virtual devices in Java, C#, .Net, Visual Basic or 
    even in pure Assembly language (see simplest.asm in examples)
